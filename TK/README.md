# TK.BAT is a windows batch script that enables the downloading of virus scanning tools and commonly used clean up tools techs need to use on a daily basis.
# It is my goal to keep it as simple as possible.
# 
# TK.EXE is a self extracting executable that launches an administrators command prompt to allow the use of the tk.bat utility
#
# TK.EXE is composed of the following files:
# 
#  - TK.BAT - Main script of the tool kit
#  - WGET.EXE - Used to download the tools
#  - 7ZA.EXE - Used to decompress tools that require it
#
#  There will be more updates to come.
